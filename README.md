A reverb that uses the raytrace algorithm for the early reflections. Sounds pretty good but could be better tbh

Todo list for if I want to work more on it:
* Frequency-domain convolution
* Chorusing of the late reflections to make the resonances less spicy
* Make it stereo
* High-pass filter (1 pole?) in the feedback loops to make the lows decay quicker
* Look into Feedback Delay Networks and see if they can make it more efficient
